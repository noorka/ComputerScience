Whenever an actor performs a move, it will go through the MoveManager's method so that history is recorded on the stack.
 Move manager will have DoMove() and UndoLastMove() methods defined, a constructor to initialize a stack, as well as a destructor to delete all the BattleMove*'s still in the stack. A MoveManager's DoMove will
